Alright, typically you should use the following command to install Python libraries: `pip install gym numpy`. Then, everything should be in the main file. I've implemented two versions of the algorithm we discussed; it's up to you to see if you can improve upon them (with the default parameters, the optimal result is around 15). Everything is customizable, of course. I'm 100% available if you have any questions, but for now, I'm going to hit the hay because I'm dead tired x)
